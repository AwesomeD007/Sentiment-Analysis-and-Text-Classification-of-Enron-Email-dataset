# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Text-Classification-of-Enron-Email-dataset
Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification of Enron Email dataset and balancing unbalanced classes

This project is aimed at building a good and reliable good text classifier with imbalanced data by 
exploring different machine-learning algorithms that work for emotion detection.

•	Text classification was used to pick the most important characteristics for the text classifier, and SMOTE, Over-sample, and Random Under-sample was used to fix the imbalanced data.
•	Used Python 3 and data processing methods, the model will be simulated.
•	Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1, recall, AUC, and visualisation was used to evaluate the model's performance on the dataset for the text classifiers
